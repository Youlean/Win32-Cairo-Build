# Win32-Cairo-Build

This is .bat script that aims to make Cairo building on Windows as simple as possible.

This script will build Cairo, Pixman, Libpng, Zlib and Freetype
Currently you can only switch Freetype on or off

Before building you will need to have installed Visual Studio 2013 or newer (it might build on older versions too)
You will probably need Windows SDK too, but I am not sure (can someone comfirm this?)


BUILDING PROCIDURE:

Just run "Youlean_Win32_Cairo_Build.bat

then check "Build" folder for headers and sources
